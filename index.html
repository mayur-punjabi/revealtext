            Harry James Potter is the titular protagonist of J. K. Rowling's
            Harry Potter series. The majority of the books' plot covers seven
            years in the life of the orphan Harry, who, on his eleventh
            birthday, learns he is a wizard. Thus, he attends Hogwarts School of
            Witchcraft and Wizardry to practice magic under the guidance of the
            kindly headmaster Albus Dumbledore and other school professors along
            with his best friends Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger. Harry also
            discovers that he is already famous throughout the novel's magical
            community, and that his fate is tied with that of Lord Voldemort –
            the internationally feared Dark Wizard and murderer of his parents,
            Lily and James. The film and book series revolve around Harry's
            struggle to adapt to the wizarding world and defeat Voldemort. Harry
            is considered a fictional icon and has been described by many
            critics, readers, and audiences as one of the greatest literary and
            film characters of all time.

            in the girls' restroom, she becomes best friends with them and often
